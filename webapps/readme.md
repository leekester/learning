# Simple Web Apps
In this folder we have some simple static Nginx websites which can be used to illustrate build and deployment concepts.
To build the applications:
* Clone the repository
* If you don't already have it, install Docker
* Change to the webapps directory
* In order to build the puppies site for example, run docker build ./puppies -t puppies:v1 -f ./puppies/dockerfile

# Azure Container Apps Deployment
Here we have Bicep to deploy: 
* a Log Analytics Workspace
* a Container App Environment
* a Container App

Update the deployment to include the name of the container registry which holds your images.  
If you require authentication to a container registry you'd need to include credentials, or use a managed identity if using ACR.
